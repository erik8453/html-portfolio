<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Erik Medina and I am 19 years old. I live in Kankakee,Il in a house with my mother and my two younger sisters. I learned basic HTML and CSS during my second year of highschool.I took a break and came back to relearn it so I can do this proffesionally and hopefully get paid for it.
I am in college and my major is computer science so I can keep pursuing web development.</p>
